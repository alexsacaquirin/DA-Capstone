# CPI AND INTEREST RATES
<h1>Summary</h1>
<p>Increasing CPI can result in higher interest rates, potentially impeding economic growth due to increased borrowing costs for consumers and businesses. On the stock market, lower interest rates typically benefit stocks, boosting corporate profits, whereas rising rates may lead to stock price declines as they eat into profits and draw investors toward fixed-income securities. </p>
